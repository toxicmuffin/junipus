## About
Juniperus is a blog template that utilizes Nuxt and Forestry. Nuxt is a Vue Javascript framework and Forestry is a git based headless content management system. 

### Scope / Thought Process

The scope of this project was to learn how a headless cms works all while familiarizing myself more with Nuxt. Since the scope of the project is overwhelmingly broad, I made the main goal for the end product to be a template. As in, anyone could use it how they see fit. I chose to do this project in the form of a template because it would mean other people besides myself could use it. Keeping that in mind, I wanted to make everything as User and Developer friendly.
